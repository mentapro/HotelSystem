# HotelSystem
- MVVM Example
- Entity Framework Example
- WPF

This application (WPF) works with database Microsoft SQL Server through Entity Framework.
I tried to write clean code. I used MVVM pattern and followed SOLID principles.

Current application represents database for hotel. There are rooms and clients. Each room can contain many clients but one client can live only in one room.
User interface is written in XAML. XAML elements use binding to show data.
